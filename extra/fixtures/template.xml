<!-- 

  Few note:
    * The file should be named after the picture you are about to tag (without
      the file extension). 
    * You do **not** need to calculate the radius of the ball. However, if you
      don't please write '-1'.
    * 'yrobot' stands for yellow robot.
    * 'brobot' stands for blue robot.
    * If an object is not on the field please, mark it's location (-1,-1).
    * Robot location should be in radians.
    
  Example:
  <frame name="shot0001.jpg">
      <ball x="20" y="20" radius="-1" />
      <yrobot x="150" y="150" rotation="3.141592653589793" />
      <brobot x="480" y="150" rotation="1.5707963267948966" />
  </frame>
